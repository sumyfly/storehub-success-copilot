# Data Flow Architecture

## Overview

The Customer Success Copilot processes data from multiple sources to generate actionable insights for Customer Success teams. This document details the data flow patterns, processing stages, and integration points.

## 🔄 Primary Data Flows

### 1. Data Ingestion Pipeline

#### Sources
- **CRM Systems**: Customer records, account information, contact details
- **Support Platforms**: Tickets, interactions, satisfaction scores
- **Product Analytics**: Usage metrics, feature adoption, user behavior
- **Billing Systems**: Revenue data, payment history, subscription changes

#### Processing Steps
```
Raw Data → Validation → Transformation → Enrichment → Storage
    ↓           ↓            ↓             ↓          ↓
External   → Quality    → Standardize  → Add      → Data
APIs       → Checks     → Schema       → Context  → Warehouse
```

#### Data Validation Rules
- **Completeness**: Required fields present
- **Consistency**: Data types and formats match
- **Freshness**: Data within acceptable time windows
- **Accuracy**: Business rule validation

```

### 3. Machine Learning Inference Flow

#### Real-time Scoring
```
Feature Store → Model Ensemble → Risk Scores → Business Rules → Alerts
     ↓              ↓              ↓             ↓              ↓
  Customer     → Multiple      → Probability  → Threshold   → Priority
  Features     → Models        → (0-1)        → Logic       → Queue
  (Redis)      → (Parallel)    → Weighted     → (Rules)     → (Redis)
```

#### Batch Processing
```
Historical Data → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Model Validation → Deployment
      ↓                 ↓                    ↓                ↓               ↓
   Warehouse      → Airflow DAG         → MLflow        → A/B Testing   → Model
   (Daily)        → (Python)            → Pipeline      → Framework     → Registry
```

### 4. Alert Generation & Distribution

#### Alert Processing Pipeline
```python
# Alert Generation Logic
def generate_alert(customer_id, risk_score, risk_factors):
    if risk_score > 0.8:
        severity = "critical"
        urgency = "immediate"
    elif risk_score > 0.6:
        severity = "high" 
        urgency = "within_24h"
    elif risk_score > 0.4:
        severity = "medium"
        urgency = "within_week"
    
    return Alert(
        customer_id=customer_id,
        severity=severity,
        urgency=urgency,
        risk_factors=risk_factors,
        suggested_actions=get_next_best_actions(customer_id, risk_factors)
    )
```

#### Distribution Channels
- **Dashboard**: Real-time updates via WebSocket
- **Slack/Teams**: Immediate notifications for critical alerts
- **Email**: Daily digest for non-urgent alerts
- **Mobile**: Push notifications for assigned CSMs

### 5. Feedback Loop & Continuous Learning

#### CSM Feedback Collection
```python
# Feedback Types
feedback_types = {
    "alert_accuracy": ["accurate", "somewhat_accurate", "inaccurate"],
    "alert_relevance": ["very_relevant", "relevant", "not_relevant"],
    "action_effectiveness": ["very_effective", "effective", "not_effective"],
    "priority_rating": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # 1=lowest, 5=highest
}
```

#### Model Retraining Triggers
- **Performance Degradation**: Accuracy drops below threshold
- **Data Drift**: Feature distributions change significantly
- **Feedback Accumulation**: Sufficient new feedback collected
- **Scheduled Retraining**: Weekly/monthly cadence

## 📊 Data Models

### Customer Health Score Model
```python
class CustomerHealthScore:
    overall_score: float  # 0.0 - 1.0
    component_scores: dict = {
        "usage_health": float,
        "engagement_health": float, 
        "support_health": float,
        "financial_health": float,
        "relationship_health": float
    }
    risk_factors: List[str]
    opportunities: List[str]
    confidence_score: float
    last_updated: datetime
    model_version: str
```

### Alert Data Model
```python
class Alert:
    id: UUID
    customer_id: UUID
    alert_type: str  # "churn_risk", "upsell_opportunity", "usage_decline"
    severity: str   # "low", "medium", "high", "critical"
    score: float    # 0.0 - 1.0
    risk_factors: List[dict]
    suggested_actions: List[dict]
    status: str     # "open", "acknowledged", "in_progress", "resolved"
    assigned_to: str
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
```

## 🔍 Data Quality & Monitoring

### Data Quality Metrics
- **Completeness**: % of required fields populated
- **Accuracy**: % of records passing validation rules
- **Consistency**: % of records matching expected formats
- **Timeliness**: Average data freshness across sources
- **Uniqueness**: % of duplicate records identified

### Monitoring Dashboards
- **Data Pipeline Health**: Success rates, processing times
- **Model Performance**: Accuracy, precision, recall over time
- **Alert Effectiveness**: CSM feedback scores, action completion rates
- **System Performance**: API response times, error rates

### Alerting Thresholds
- **Data Pipeline**: > 5% failure rate or > 2 hour delay
- **Model Performance**: < 80% accuracy or > 10% drift
- **System Performance**: > 500ms API response time
- **Data Quality**: < 95% completeness or accuracy

## 🚨 Error Handling & Recovery

### Data Pipeline Resilience
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Fallback Data**: Use cached or estimated values
- **Manual Overrides**: Admin controls for emergency situations

### Model Fallback Strategies
- **Model Versioning**: Rollback to previous stable version
- **Ensemble Fallback**: Use simpler models if complex ones fail
- **Rule-based Backup**: Business rules when ML unavailable
- **Human Override**: CSM can override model recommendations

This data flow architecture ensures reliable, scalable, and accurate processing of customer success data while maintaining high availability and data quality standards.
